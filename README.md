Danny is turning 30! Time for a puzzle.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a Python environment with Python version 3.9
3. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Download the model (`python download_model.py`)
5. Check instructions (`python instructions.py`)
6. Solve riddle; adapt `main.py` (check `train.py` for hints), run `main.py`
7. Check `mystery_image.png`; it should contain a meaningful image :-)

Good luck!
